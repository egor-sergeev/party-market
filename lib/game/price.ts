/**
 * Calculates the new stock price based on market depth and order size.
 * Uses a sigmoid-based liquidity curve that naturally handles edge cases:
 * - Large orders have diminishing price impact
 * - Impact is higher in thin markets (few stocks owned)
 * - Small orders in liquid markets have minimal impact
 * - Prevents negative or zero prices through natural bounds
 * - Selling has symmetrical impact to buying
 * - Includes controlled randomness for market unpredictability
